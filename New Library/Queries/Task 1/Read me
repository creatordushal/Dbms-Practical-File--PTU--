What is Column 'user_id' in field list is ambiguous” error?  

This error occurs when you are trying to fetch some data from multiple tables with the help of a join query. 
But if the same field name is present in both tables, and you are not passing the table name as part of the column identifier, 
the query will be unsuccessful.

Solution

In this solution, you can see that the table name is specified using dot (.). Aliases u is for one table and ud is for another table. 
So, MySQL does not get confused after encountering u.user_id and ud.user_id. The query is executed successfully.
